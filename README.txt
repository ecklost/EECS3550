// EECS 3550 Software Engineering
// For Professor Dr. Jackson de Carvalho
// Due Tuesday, February 28th, 2017

// This project was created by Tina Ach and Eric Klostermeyer. About half the
// coding was done by each person with Tina handling the control flow and
// subprogram control with some methods in stack manipulation and operators,
// while Eric handlded everything else and filling in any code snippets from Tina.

// To run the code, simply start Visual Studio, choose Open->Project/Solution and then
// point to the Jaz_Intr.sln file after clicking into the folder. Then, build the project (ctrl+shift+b) and
// run the code from there (F5).
